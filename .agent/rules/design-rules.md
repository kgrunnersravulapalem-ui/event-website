- Use React functional components and hooks.
- Documentation of all components and APIs mandatory.
- Use pnpm as package manager.
- Accessibility and responsiveness tested thoroughly.
- We want to go with NextJS.
- Create components and use them appropriately.
- First create individual components(Buttons, Input, ect).
- Maintain design consistency all over the application.
- Design should be minimal, attractive and should be modern.
- If possible we can add some toasts in the app. 
- Our work should be industry standard.
- Maintain styles in spearate files.
- Never ever write inline styles.

Coding Guidelines & UI Rules

- Follow the **Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide** for code consistency.  
- Use **functional components** with **React hooks** exclusively (no class components).  
- Document all **public APIs and components** clearly with comments and README updates.  
- Use **descriptive, meaningful names** for variables and functions.  
- Maintain an **up-to-date changelog** with each release.  
- **No inline styles** in JSX.  
- Use **CSS Modules or styled-components** for styling and theming.  
- Ensure **accessibility best practices** (ARIA roles, keyboard navigation, color contrast).  
- Break UI into **smaller, reusable components** for maintainability.  
- Use **pnpm only** for package management across the project.  
- The frontend framework will be **Next.js** (React-based, server-side rendering support).
